# Wind Power Feasibility

* The application aims to predict the feasibility results in case of wind turbine investment on any selected coordinate.
* Forecasts are made according to the actual wind speed data received over the internet according to the selected location. 1 year historical data are taken. The frequency range of the data is 1 hour. In other words, estimates are made based on approximately 8760 wind speed data.
* The Weibull probability density function, which is generally used in wind power estimation, was used as the estimation method.
